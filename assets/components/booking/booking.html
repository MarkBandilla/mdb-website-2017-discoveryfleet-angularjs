		<h3>Dive and Travel Insurance</h3>
		<p><strong> </strong>Discovery Fleet Corp. (DFC) <strong>requires their clients to have dive and travel insurance.</strong> DFC is <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>not liable for cancellation of trips due to force majeure/weather or other unforeseen circumstances</strong> including <strong>medical emergencies/diving accidents</strong> </span>necessitating the return of the vessel to the nearest port/medical facility to seek help.&nbsp; A full refund will be given to the agent if DFC declares a cancellation BEFORE embarkation.&nbsp; The agent will then be in charge of finding alternate accommodation of passengers at their expense. If cancellation was made upon embarkation time, no refund will be given and DFC will find an alternate accommodation for the passengers on DFC expense.</p>
		<p>In case of mechanical problems or boat breakdown before or while the trip is underway, DFC will make the best effort to provide alternate accommodation. Should this be unavailable, DFC will refund ONLY the unused portion of the trip. Please make sure that airline tickets are re-bookable or refundable. DFC will not be responsible for transportation expenses beyond what is included in the dive package – i.e. local airport to ship transfers.</p>
		<p>Refunds for trip cancellation will be done though bank to bank wire transfer ONLY due to security and AMLA restrictions. We will not entertain demands for cash refunds/transactions at our office.</p>

The Divers Alert Network (DAN) is a global network of not-for-profit, member-based, dive safety organisations working for the safety of all divers through education, research and training. <br> <br> DAN AP provides Worldwide Emergency Evacuation Coverage and optional Dive Injury (Treatment) Insurance Services for Members. In addition the organisation is responsible for funding and/or manning 24-hour diving emergency hotlines throughout the Asia-Pacific region.<br> <br> DAN AP is a part of the International DAN Federation of Dive Safety Organisations with worldwide Membership presently exceeding 300,000.<br> <br> Wherever members live or dive around the world they have peace of mind knowing that DAN is available 24-hours a day, 7 days a week to assist in the event of an accident/illness.<br> <br> <strong>Why is it so important that as Divers we are protected with DAN Membership &amp; Dive Injury (Treatment) Insurance?</strong></p>
		                <p style="text-align: justify;">It’s all about being prepared for the unexpected, namely dive accidents and illnesses. It’s essential that divers have a reputable organisation to call that will be able to co-ordinate a rescue effort and get them to the most appropriate treatment for their injury or illness. And then there is the issue of cost. DAN protection ensures the diver will not be lumbered with the burden of a potentially hefty invoice in the event of an accident or illness.<br> <strong><br> An Example</strong></p>
		                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Recently DAN was involved in the evacuation of a paralysed diver from  the Solomon Islands to Australia. The evacuation cost was around  AUD$90,000 (as an aircraft had to be sourced from far away). In  addition, the treatment costs were in excess of US$30,000, plus on-going  expenses.<br><br> The essence of DAN Membership &amp; Dive Injury (Treatment) Insurance is  about being prepared. DAN offers members peace-of-mind, which comes  from knowing they have the experts in diver accident management to call  in the event of a diving accident or illness. </strong> <br> <br></p>
